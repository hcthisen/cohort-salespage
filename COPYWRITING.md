[TRUST / HOST INTRO STRIP]

Section Label:
H2: Hosted by Hans from Scale By Tech

Short Paragraph:
Hi, I’m Hans. I’ve been quietly building small apps and web tools for myself and for clients, the kind of small, focused apps that actually get used. I call it “microapps”: building fast, staying small, and shipping things that move the needle.

Examples (bulleted list / logos-style row):
Text: Some apps and tools I’ve built:
- Apps with user login:
  - [microapp.live](https://microapp.live)
  - [journal.vet](https://journal.vet)
  - [migrate.microapp.live](https://migrate.microapp.live)
- Webtools with automation:
  - [Aquaculture UV model selector for desmi.com](https://www.desmi.com)
  - [tools.scalebytech.com/youtube-transcript](https://tools.scalebytech.com/youtube-transcript)
- Simple webtools:
  - [microapp.live/hcthisen/teleprompter](https://microapp.live/hcthisen/teleprompter)
  - [microapp.live/hcthisen/website-value-calculator](https://microapp.live/hcthisen/website-value-calculator)

  - [microapp.live/hcthisen/solar-roi](https://microapp.live/hcthisen/solar-roi)

Short line for authority:
Text: This cohort is everything I’ve learned from building real tools, distilled into 3 weeks of focused implementation.


[SECTION: BIG IDEA / WHY MICROAPPS]

H2:
Why Microapps Are the Biggest (Quiet) Opportunity Right Now

Paragraph 1:
Right now the biggest arbitrage, at least in my opinion, is simple microapps. Tiny tools that actually solve a problem. They’re fast to build, easy to ship, and useful on day one.

Paragraph 2:
Instead of chasing “the next big platform” or a 12-month SaaS project, we’ll stack small wins: simple tools, focused webapps, and automations that help real people get things done.

Bulleted list: What makes microapps so powerful:
- Fast to build: You can go from idea to working prototype in hours, not weeks.
- Easy to ship: Small scope = less complexity = fewer ways to get stuck.
- Immediately useful: You can use them in your own business or sell them to clients.
- Stackable: A handful of small tools can add up to real revenue and impact.

Short hook line:
Text: Tiny apps. Real results. That’s the whole game.


[SECTION: WHAT YOU’LL WALK AWAY WITH]

H2:
By the End of the Cohort, You Will…

Bulleted Outcomes:
- Ship a functional microapp or web app  
  Text: Your app will be live on your own domain or subdomain, with a real use case and real users in mind.

- Understand the full path from idea → live app  
  Text: From quick prompts in ChatGPT to front-end code, automations, backend, hosting, and DNS, you’ll see the full pipeline.

- Know how to self-host on a VPS  
  Text: We’ll spin up a VPS, configure basics, and deploy so you control your own stack, data, and costs.

- Know which tools to use at each level of complexity  
  Text: Tiny HTML widget? Automation-heavy webtool? Full web app with logins and databases? You’ll know what to reach for and when.

- Have repeatable templates and workflows  
  Text: You’ll leave with processes and patterns you can reuse for future apps or client projects.

- Have the confidence to build “just big enough” tools  
  Text: No bloated architecture, no endless refactors, just clean, functional microapps that get used.


[SECTION: WHO THIS IS FOR / NOT FOR]

H2:
Is the Vibe Coding Cohort Right for You?

Subheading:
Let’s make sure this is a good fit.

Two Columns:

Column 1 Title:
H3: This Is For You If…

Bullets:
- You’re new to building apps or haven’t shipped one yet, but you’re ready to change that.
- You want practical skills to create your own web tools, not just theory or copy-paste tutorials.
- You see the opportunity to sell microapps and tools to businesses.
- You like the idea of owning your infrastructure with self-hosting instead of relying only on no-code platforms.
- You’re okay with a hands-on, slightly scrappy “vibe coding” style, fast, iterative, and focused on shipping.

Column 2 Title:
H3: This Is Not For You If…

Bullets:
- You’ve already built multiple production apps solo and are looking for advanced scaling or architecture topics.
- You want to build “the next HubSpot” in 3 weeks. That’s not what we’re doing here.
- You’re expecting a polished, enterprise-style bootcamp with 20 instructors and a giant team.
- You don’t want to touch any code at all. We will use tools, but you’ll write and understand code too.
- You’re more interested in marketing and customer acquisition than building, that’s a different topic and not covered here.

[SECTION: WHAT WE’LL BUILD – THE THREE TIERS]

H2:
Choose Your Level: From Simple Widgets to Full Web Apps

Intro Paragraph:
Not everyone needs a full-blown SaaS. That’s why the cohort is structured around three tiers of complexity. You’ll pick the tier that fits your skills, time, and goals, and you can always move up later.

Tier 1 Box:
Title: Tier 1 – Pure Frontend Microapps  
Subtitle: No backend. Super simple. Surprisingly powerful.

Description:
You’ll build small tools with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by ChatGPT and microapp.live.

Examples:
- A teleprompter you can use for video recording.
- A website value calculator.
- A terrace builder or solar ROI calculator.

Outcome:
Perfect if you want to ship something useful quickly and learn the basics of frontend and deployment without worrying about databases yet.

Tier 2 Box:
Title: Tier 2 – Frontend + Automation Backend  
Subtitle: When you need AI, APIs, and small automations.

Description:
You’ll connect your frontend to a backend made of automation tools like Make.com or n8n and whatever API services the app needs. This is ideal for webtools that process data, talk to APIs, or call AI.

Examples:
- A web tool that uses AI to summarize YouTube transcripts.
- A selector tool like the aquaculture UV model selector for desmi.com.
- Forms and tools that trigger workflows and send outputs to users.

Outcome:
You’ll learn how to glue together a smart frontend with powerful automation backends, without overbuilding infrastructure.

Tier 3 Box:
Title: Tier 3 – Full Web App  
Subtitle: User accounts, databases, automations, and more.

Description:
For those ready to go deeper, we’ll build full web apps with user logins, databases, and automation integrations. Here we bring in VPS hosting with backup, Supabase, GitHub, and GPT Codex.

Example:
- [journal.vet](https://journal.vet), an app built for a veterinarian clinic with user accounts and real-world workflows.

Outcome:
You’ll understand how to build focused, real web apps, not huge platforms, but specialized tools that are actually used in specific niches.


[SECTION: STACK & TOOLS YOU’LL LEARN]

H2:
Tools, Stack, and Costs (No Surprise Expenses)

Intro Paragraph:
This cohort is about practical building with a realistic budget. We’ll keep tool costs as low as possible while still using a solid, modern stack.

Subheading:
H3: Core Tools We’ll Use

Bulleted List:
- ChatGPT (or GPT Codex via web) for coding help and generation.
- microapp.live for quickly shipping small tools and micro frontends.
- Automation tools for Tier 2:
  - Make.com and/or n8n
  - Relevant API services depending on your app
- Full app stack for Tier 3:
  - VPS hosting (with backups)
  - Supabase for database and auth
  - GitHub for version control and collaboration
  - GPT Codex / ChatGPT for coding workflows

Subheading:
H3: Self-Hosting & Cost Breakdown

Bulleted List:
- VPS: You can do most things on a $5–$10/month server.
- ChatGPT Plus: Around $20/month. This is a key part of the workflow.
- Domain or sub-domain: Roughly $12/year.
- Self-hostable tools:
  - You can self-host Supabase.
  - You can self-host n8n for automation.
- Reality check:
  - There is no true “free” version of doing this.
  - Around $30/month is roughly the minimum to play this game properly.

Short Note:
Text: The goal is not to pile on subscriptions. It’s to help you control your stack, control your data, and control your costs.


[SECTION: WHAT’S INCLUDED (OFFER STACK)]

H2:
What You Get When You Join the Vibe Coding Cohort

Offer Stack Bullets:
- 3 Weeks of Structured Training and Implementation  
  Text: Clear step-by-step guidance from idea to deployed microapp or web app.

  Text: No fluff. Just the concepts and examples you need to keep moving and avoid getting stuck.

- Closed Community on Skool.com
  Text: Ask questions, share progress, get feedback, and learn from what others are building. You’ll receive the invitation link via email within 24 hours of payment.

- Weekly Group Calls  
  Text: Live sessions around 20:00 CET / 3 pm EDT. Exact day will be decided by a vote among cohort members.

- 2 Individual 30-Minute Calls with Me (Hans)  
  Text: We’ll use these to unblock you, review your app, and polish it so you can ship with confidence.

- Lifetime Access to Courses Created from the Cohort  
  Text: The cohort will be turned into 3 structured courses (one for each complexity tier) hosted on Skool.com. Cohort members are grandfathered in with no additional cost.

- Recording Access  
  Text: All calls will be recorded, so you can rewatch or catch up if you can’t attend live.

Clarifying Line:
Text: This is about learning the tools and processes to go from zero to functional webtools/mini apps, not about marketing or customer acquisition. That’s a different game.

Paragraph:
I know the language barrier can be a challenge on live calls. So here’s what I’ll do: I will create Korean-translated (audio-dubbed) versions of all the videos. If you still feel it’s too hard or you’re not getting the value you wanted, you can ask for a refund. It’s the best option I can think of to make this accessible and still keep it live and interactive.


[SECTION: FAQ]

H2:
Frequently Asked Questions

FAQ Item 1:
Q: I’m pretty new to coding. Can I still join?  
A:
Yes. If you’re new to building apps or haven’t shipped one yet, this is exactly for you. We’ll keep things practical and focused on getting you to a working microapp. You don’t need to be an expert, just willing to learn and implement.

FAQ Item 2:
Q: How much time should I expect to invest each week?  
A:
Plan for 5–7 hours per week. That includes watching short videos, building your app, joining the live calls (or watching replays), and using your 1:1 time. The more you put in, the more you’ll get out, but this is designed to be realistic for people with busy schedules.

FAQ Item 3:
Q: What if I can’t attend the live calls?  
A:
No problem. All calls will be recorded and uploaded to Skool.com. You can submit questions in advance, and I’ll cover them on the call so you still get the value when you watch the replay.

FAQ Item 4:
Q: Will you teach marketing and customer acquisition too?  
A:
No. This cohort focuses purely on tools and processes to build functional webtools and microapps. Marketing and customer acquisition are different skillsets and not part of this program.

FAQ Item 5:
Q: What tools will I need to buy?  
A:
At a minimum, you’ll need:
- A VPS in the $5–$10/month range.
- ChatGPT Plus (around $20/month).
- A domain or sub-domain (about $12/year).
We’ll also use tools like microapp.live, Make.com/n8n, Supabase, and GitHub. I’ll always suggest low-cost, practical options and show you where you can self-host to save money.

FAQ Item 6:
Q: Is there a “free” way to do this?  
A:
Not really. You can experiment with free tiers here and there, but realistically, around $30/month is the minimum to play this game properly if you want reliability and control.

FAQ Item 7:
Q: What if I don’t know what app to build?  
A:
We’ll figure it out together. In Week 1, we’ll brainstorm and scope an app that fits your level and your goals. I’ll help you choose something you can actually finish in 3 weeks that still feels meaningful.

FAQ Item 8:
Q: I’ve already built a few apps. Is this still useful?  
A:
Maybe. If you’ve already built multiple production apps solo and want advanced scaling topics, this might not be the best fit. But if you want to systemize your microapp workflow, learn self-hosting, or explore the Tier 2 and Tier 3 stacks with guidance, you can still get a lot out of it.

FAQ Item 9:
Q: What if I join and realize it’s not for me?  
A:
If you join and honestly feel it’s not delivering the value you expected, just ask for a refund. I’d rather you feel good about the decision than feel stuck.

FAQ Item 10:
Q: Will I have something to show at the end?  
A:
Yes. The core promise of this cohort is simple: ship a functional microapp or web app by the end. That’s what we’re optimizing everything around.
